# Hass Addon: FRP Client

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.1.0-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/huxiaoxu2019/hass-addon-frp-client/tree/v1.0.0)
This addon is based on [huxiaoxu2019/hass-addon-frp-client](https://github.com/huxiaoxu2019/hass-addon-frp-client). 
The primary goal of this addon is to support **TCP** proxy instead of the **HTTP** proxy. This enables the use of the FRP server behind a reverse proxy server such as nginx for advanced configuration.
